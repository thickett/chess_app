### GUI program
1) create basic GUI for start screen
    - have widgets for start game, quit. 
        - when start game is selected, need to create a new window. 
            create TopLevel for this. I.e when button clicked command= new_window function (using Toplevel)
        - could have a simple chess puzzle in a mini chess game titled "start" and one titled "quit" (do this later if at all)

2) Create the chessboard on the new window. For now white always at the bottom black always at the top.
    - need to create an 8x8 grid with some sort of theme. cant just by black/white or something.
    - need to get images for chess pieces?
    - need to put chess images in the right starting positions.
    - need labels on grid? i.e A1,A2 etc
    - interface to the side of the board for the purpose of tracking pieces lost
    - quit/restart button



### pieces program

1) define the pieces
    - piece name,
    - current location on the board (not sure where this is stored, does this need to be kept on the GUI side, do we make a call to pieces.location after every move? IDK yet.)
        - when a piece moves, delete old location, update with new location. (should this be in logic?....)
    - colour
    - how they can move?
        - all in a dictonary?
    


### logic program

1) define how the pieces can move

2) using information stored in pieces, check which moves are possible, i.e what squeres it can move to.
    - check how they can move
    - of those coords it can move to, which are available? is it a reall cord? is there another pieces current location in the way? is it a legal move for that piece?
